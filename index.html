        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer from STL MO. I've always had a strong work ethic and have been regularly promoted in my past jobs, due to covid i had lost my job as a restaurant manager in March 2020 which spurred on a rough year where i ended up deciding to make the big switch to software engineering.

          To render an APi that persists throughout the app to play song files we had to create a context in the state to constantly add and take away songs from the player itself based on which song/playlist you chose to listen to.
          Using AWS we created a file upload system so users can create their own songs and playlists with their unique album art. We had to build a full route,multiple flask files, and a full API route to React/Redux to render the newly made songs.
          To create a seamless experience when creating, editing, or deleting a comment we used Redux state to automatically listen for those changes to dynamically render them.

          Using the Google Maps API and the Google Geocoding API I created a map of all of the spots that were available to be booked along with the corresponding markers, this applies to newly created ones as well.
          I created a search component that searches the database for the corresponding address the user has typed in as well as updating the Google Maps appropriately.
          A user can host new spots, and review other spots as well, when hosting a user uploads 5 images for the spot and adds a nice description.
